Witchcraft is a side scroller that was written by Ralph Erdt and Andreas Textor for the
Programming 3 course at the University of Applied Sciences Wiesbaden during the
winter semester 06/07. The player controls a witch on her flying broom and can use spells
and heavy weapons to shoot plenty of different creatures. There are 3 levels, 4 weapons -
frog spell, magic detonator (guided missiles), gonne (machine gun), hexenschuss
(Note: this is the german word for lumbago, used as a pun) (railgun); 7 different enemies,
3 skill settings and the possibility to save the game. The game was written in Java.  

Note that the game (and the detailed documentation) is in german, but there isn't really much to read.
